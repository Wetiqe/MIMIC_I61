    "# Predicting Mortality Rate Among Non-traumatic Intracerebral Haemorrhage Patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Using MIMIC-IV Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will investigate the mortality rate of patients with non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage in the intensive care unit. We intend to compare the accuracy of mortality rate using three different classifiers, namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, and random forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it critical to determine the mortality rate of patients with non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage? Stroke is a major health issue that affects people all over the world. Nontraumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a type of stroke in which a hematoma forms within the brain parenchyma, with or without blood extension into the ventricles (Rajashekar & Liang 2022). ICH affects over 2 million people each year and accounts for up to 10%–15% of all strokes (Cordonnier et al., 2018; Vilela & Wiesmann, 2020), with long-term morbidity and a high mortality rate when compared to other types of strokes (Tatlisumak et al., 2018). Carolei et al. (1997) and Van Asch et al. (2010) estimate that approximately 35% of ICH patients die within seven days, and approximately 50% die within 30 days. Furthermore, the global cost of caring for ICH patients, particularly those in intensive care units, is enormous (ICUs). As a result, it becomes critical to predict the mortality rate among ICH patients as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "ICH scores were previously used to determine mortality (Hemphill et al., 2001). The ICH score is calculated in the first minute of a patient's visit using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), haemorrhage volume (cm3), intraventricular haemorrhage status, haemorrhage site (supra or infratentorial), and patient's age (Rahmani et al., 2018). The ICH score must be assessed by experienced radiologists and neurologists, which is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult for inexperienced users (Nie et al., 2021). APACHE II and SAPS II are reliable predictors of mortality in ICU patients (Lee et al., 2015; Godinjak et al., 2016). These scores use traditional statistical analysis to identify the most relevant covariates from preselected features, resulting in model oversimplification and discretization, reduced covariates, and poor model performance (Nie et al., 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the limitations of the methods mentioned above, it is necessary to employ machine learning algorithms. The advantage of machine learning methods is that they allow for the automatic discovery of important variables and empirical patterns in data. It starts with the patient's observation and selects many variables to identify the combination that can predict the outcomes reliably. Machine learning can deal with variables with complex interactions using a variety of algorithms that do not make linear assumptions. Another advantage of machine learning is that it can process many predicted values, allowing for a more comprehensive and in-depth exploration of big data.\n"

    "MIMIC is a very large dataset, hence we only selected some part of it. We included the tables from four modules: core, ed, hosp, and icu:\n",
    "* core:**The core module stores patient tracking information necessary for any data analysis using MIMIC-IV. The core module contains three tables: patients, admissions, and transfers. These tables provide demographics for the patient, a record for each hospitalization, and a record for each ward stay within a hospitalization.**\n",
    "* ed:**Patient stays are tracked in the edstays table. Each row of the edstays table has a unique stay_id, which represents a unique patient stay in the ED. The edstays table contains the following columns: subject_id, hadm_id, stay_id, intime, and outtime. The intime indicates the time at which the patient was admitted to the ED, and the outtime indicates the time at which the patient was discharged from the ED. If the patient was admitted to the hospital following their ED stay, the hadm_id column will be populated with an identifier representing their hospital stay. hadm_id can be linked with the hadm_id in MIMIC-IV to obtain further detail about the patient’s hospital stay. Finally, each individual is assigned a unique subject_id, and patients with multiple ED stays will have the same subject_id across stays in the edstays table. Note that subject_id can be linked with MIMIC-IV to obtain patient demographics. subject_id can also be linked with the PatientID DICOM attribute in MIMIC-CXR to obtain chest x-rays for patients if they were taken**\n",
    "* hosp:**The hosp module contains data derived from the hospital wide EHR. These measurements are predominantly recorded during the hospital stay, though some tables include data from outside the hospital as well (e.g. outpatient laboratory tests in labevents). Information includes laboratory measurements (labevents, d_labitems), microbiology cultures (microbiologyevents, d_micro), provider orders (poe, poe_detail), medication administration (emar, emar_detail), medication prescription (prescriptions, pharmacy), hospital billing information**\n",
    "* icu:**The icu module contains data sourced from the clinical information system at the BIDMC: MetaVision (iMDSoft). MetaVision tables were denormalized to create a star schema where the icustays and d_items tables link to a set of data tables all suffixed with events. Data documented in the icu module includes intravenous and fluid inputs (inputevents), patient outputs (outputevents), procedures (procedureevents), information documented as a date or time (datetimeevents), and other charted information (chartevents). All events tables contain a stay_id column allowing identification of the associated ICU patient in icustays, and an itemid column allowing identification of the concept documented in d_items.**\n",

    "We will take a glance at these modules first.MIMIC is a very large dataset; hence we only selected some part of it. We included the tables from four modules: `core`, `ed`, `hosp`, and `icu`. We will take a glance at these modules first."
